Once upon a time, a small transformer model learned to generate text.
It practiced every day, reading stories, conversations, and instructions.
Even though it was small, it tried to understand patterns in language.

Deep learning models improve by training on large amounts of data.
The more examples a model sees, the better it becomes at predicting the next token.
Transformers use attention mechanisms to focus on different parts of the input sequence.

The cat sat on the mat.
The dog barked loudly at the moon.
A programmer wrote code late into the night.
Simple sentences help the model learn grammar.

Human conversations are full of questions and answers.
What is your name?
My name is MiniGPT.
How are you today?
I am learning how to generate text.

Instructions help guide the model.
To boil water, heat it until bubbles appear.
To write code, start by defining a clear goal.
To train a model, prepare clean and meaningful data.

Mathematics is essential for machine learning.
Two plus two equals four.
The derivative of x squared is two x.
A matrix is a grid of numbers that can be multiplied.

Stories help the model learn creativity.
The robot looked at the stars and wondered about the universe.
A traveler walked across the desert searching for a lost city.
A young student dreamed of building intelligent machines.

This is a sample training corpus for a small transformer model.
Feel free to expand this file with more text to improve performance.
Consistent style and clear formatting will help the model learn effectively.
